# Survey Tool - Ruby

_Please review the [main README](../../README.md) for overall instructions._

Welcome to the Ruby starter kit for the survey tool exercise!

Included here is a simple CLI executable, a `lib/cli.rb` to hold the beginnings of your
application logic, plus an RSpec installation and a single failing integration test, which
should help you drive the beginning of your implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby (version specified in `.tool-versions`, but feel free to adjust the setup for your
  environment)

## Development

### Installing dependencies

``` sh
bundle install
```

### Testing

``` sh
bundle exec rspec spec
```

### Running

``` sh
./bin/survey-tool
```
