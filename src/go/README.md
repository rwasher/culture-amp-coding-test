# Survey Tool - Go

_Please review the [main README](../../README.md) for overall instructions._

Welcome to the Go starter kit for the survey tool exercise!

Included here is a simple `main.go` with a `main()` function for invoking the application
as a CLI, and a separate `Run` function for holding the beginnings of your application
logic. Thereâ€™s also a lightweight table test defined in `main_test.go` which should
help you drive the beginning of your implementation.
